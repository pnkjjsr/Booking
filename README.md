First, prioritize the list of tasks below from high to low (1 -> top priority, 6-> lowest priority). Please explain why you choose to prioritize this way, and what you considered when assigning high or low priority to each task.


 *  Imagine there is a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one.
 	Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page.

 *  Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user
	to sort the reviews by review score.

 *  Improve the room table. Allow the user to sort the room table by occupancy
 	or price, display a total when the user selects a quantity, display
 	additional information about rooms.

 *  Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails
	currently in the page. Include an automatic	slideshow mode, add prev/next
	buttons to manually controll the carousel, add a layer that shows the
	contents of the images alt text.

 *  Improve the facilities block.

 *  Add an interactive location block to the page. It should contain a map and
 	some nearby landmarks.
