__First, prioritize the list of tasks below from high to low (1 -> top priority, 6-> lowest priority). Please explain why you choose to prioritize this way, and what you considered when assigning high or low priority to each task.__

    1.  Improve the facilities block.
        -- Implement few design changes like, add icons according to facility does not take much time.

    2.  Add an interactive location block to the page. It should contain a map and some nearby landmarks.
        -- I believe "Google Map" API will work well for this task and after getting google location API, it won't be tough to add location block.

    3.  Imagine there is a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one. Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page.
        -- Create a JSON feed would be first priority for me to complete all JavaScript tasks.  Fetching content by JSON and put into the HTML make this task as actual job task.  Also, I am using JSON feed for below task like, "Reviews", "Photo Gallery".

    4.  Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user to sort the reviews by review score.
        -- I choose this task as second priority because showing content by JSON is pretty easy and it takes less time.

    5.  Improve the room table. Allow the user to sort the room table by occupancy or price, display a total when the user selects a quantity, display additional information about rooms.
        -- This task would be 2nd high time consuming and that's why i place it on second-last position.
    
    6. Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails currently in the page. Include an automatic slideshow mode, add prev/next
	buttons to manually control the carousel, add a layer that shows the contents of the images alt text.
        -- I believe, creating a own CAROUSAL won't be tough, but it takes lots of "lines of code" and "Time".  Because of time consuming task I will do this task in the last.  I would like to complete 5 task first in a day instead of 1 task which will take a week.



__Second, pick at least two tasks out of the list and implement them. You may choose whatever tasks you prefer that you think will best reflect your coding skills. Browser support should include IE8+, Chrome, Safari, FF.__    
    
    1.  Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page.
    2.  Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination.
    3.  Photo carousel
            -- Include an automatic slideshow mode
            -- Add prev/next buttons
            -- Add a layer that shows the contents of the images alt text.
